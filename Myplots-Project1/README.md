## Instructions

To run the code for plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R you will need to feed 
them with the data file: "household_power_consumption.txt"
from source:

<b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

Then use the function from each file makePlot_i(filename) for i=1,2,3,4 which will create a plot as instructed for Project 1.
